#LukkariMiner client

This is built with angular & a node API.

##Building

```
npm install
gulp dependencies
```

##Developing

All app files are in ./app. These get compiled & built to ./dest.
I gave up Bower so there's still some work to do managing dependencies.

##Running

```
Start a local mongod
Lift the server
gulp watch
```
